# Automation-Script
AutomationScriptEngine is a XML-based DSL that allows developers write scripts to automate existing Win32 applications.


Automation script is a custom DSL developed for automating Windows-based applications, even for creating fully automated tests.
It’s XML-based. It’s not bound to CCF (now USD), hence it can be used from any other .NET application.
It’s composed by a series of steps, which may (or not) contain some pre-requisites that must be met in order to proceed to the next step.
Its main purpose is to provide a starting point for creating automation-based solutions, without forcing the developers to spend time working
on the Win32 plumbing, but helping them to focus on the business requirements.
